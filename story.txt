Under a rubble of old junk, a leather bound book stood out to Claire. The book was completely covered in dust. She coughed as she lifted it up and attempted to examine it. What on Earth is this? she mumbled. Oh my goodness! Its a Computer Science 400 book! Who is it by, Claire asked herself? "Debra Deppeler!". Claire opened up the book and flipped the page to Binary Search Trees. "This is incredible" she said. As she read the pages she learned more and more until she finally understood it all. Then the next chapter began, "AVL trees". Looking at the chapter Claire began to devour the information. Wow!! You can rotate each node right and left, and then combine left and right rotate to balance any tree. But wait there is this thing called a "Red Black Tree". After hours of reading about "Red Black Trees", Claire came to one big problem. How do you delete a black leaf node? She searched through the book, and internet, but she couldn't find a definite answer. Suddenly, Debra Deppler flew through the window and said one thing that Claire would never forget.
